# extinction

A repository for my recent engineering to move a lantern around my porch powered by two stepper motors. 
The lantern is attached to the stepper motors via spools of fishing line. As the motors turn, they either
bring in or let out the fishing line allowing me to position the lantern anywhere I want on the front of
porch.

This version moves the lantern (an "asteroid") from the top right to the bottom left of the porch where
there are two inflatable dinosaurs sitting. When the asteroid arrives, Hue lights errupt in colors and the
Atomic Bomb sound plays, because the asteroid explodes. Then the lights go up, the lantern resets, and
everything starts again.
